A simple countdown timer for slides and HTML documents written in 'Jupyter' or 'Quarto'. Integrates fully into 'Shiny for Python' apps. Countdown to something amazing.

## Coming Soon (TM)

We're currently working toward implementing a Python package for countdown. 
This will likely come over the next couple of months.

In the interim, we suggest viewing the [`Quarto`](../quarto) or [`R`](../r/) extensions.
